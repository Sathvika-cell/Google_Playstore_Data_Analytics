The main category often includes various types (notes) of expenses, and some expense types repeat by the end of the month. If we had the option to add an expense type once at the beginning of the month and then repeat it within that type, it would help us better track and understand the total amount spent on a specific type (note).",

Hope that there's a combined income and expense statistics that red and green are all into one analysis so it'll be much simple. Overall, it's good!",

I'm finding this much more useful than just a budget app since I can track my actual expenses to ensure I don't over spend. it would be great to be able to enter recurring transactions but that may result in less attention giving to the balance tracking",

If I pay $200 toward a $1000 credit card bill, the balance should decrease to $800, not increase to $1200. In order to correct the balance, it has to be manually changed.",

One small suggestion would be to add an option to split the payment source for a single expense during entry. Right now, if I pay partly by cash and partly through an app, I have to enter it as two separate transactions. Still, it's easily a 5-star app ‚Äî highly recommended!",

It has also helped me see trends like months where a specific expense increases per year (say gifting), and pre-plan for it. The ads are minimal and do not feel too intrusive.",

While I won't ideally advise the import, the export is solid and can be backed up on Google Drive too. Go for the Pro subscription as you get a good number of features!",

Also be able to transfer money from an ACC to a goal, but count it as an expense from a budget not a global expense. I don't know if I'm explaining correctly. Either way, I'll keep it installed to see its future updates as I want to switch systems",

The concept of the app is also great- it will never track your expenses via credit card messages.. so they have taken care of privacy. Very simple user interface and easy to use.

So, the banks waive off the annual charges on the credit cards based upon a certain amount spent annually. Now, at times one may miss it by just a few hundreds , that too because you were unaware of the fact that you have spent enough to get the waiver and the banks end up levying the annual charges.  In case, we have an option which tracks how much has been spent by which credit card, the above situation can be avoided.  I know you have the sufficient data to get this problem resolved.  Thanks.",

Like the same way it shows you daily, weekly and monthly statistic, it as should also allow you to see from day X of 1 to day X of month, since in terms of money, a \"month\" only starts counting once you get your paycheck.",

There was previously an option that allowed you to exclude future transactions from your reports. And the loading time is awful; it takes a good minute for my info or transactions to load. I was really loyal to this app and even recommended it to a few of my friends since it worked so well for me. But the update was just horrible. I wonder if this company even did any market research before wasting their time and effort on that garbage update. Fortunately, I found a new app that works similarly to the old Spendee.

Every single app I have purchased so far takes the money at the end of the trial! In addition I'm not able to connect to Revolut. There's a constant error message that they cannot connect to the bank. I tried several times. I can see my accounts with the correct amounts however no transaction history. At the end I paid to see that there's no connection to the bank. UPDATE 10.01 I successfully managed to add all my bank accounts however i uninstall the app. My reasons: 1. you cannot make a budget with labels. The only option is to use the categories. 2. there's no automatic matching process for transfers between my account. I need to match them manual. 3. I didn't not see a learning process for automatic categorization. My transactions for the past 2 months were wrongly categorized and as most of them are repetitive a learning process would be nice to have. 4. I cannot share bank accounts with family members. Only manually created accounts. This means second family member to connect to my bank accounts with another subscription. For example we have shared accounts and I want to share just the balance. 5. 50% of the bank sync process ended up with errors. 6. I cannot edit anything with status pending. I know that the status is coming from the bank but why I'm not able to change simple things as the category or match the transfer between two accounts? I will give 3 stars as it's good app but they definitely can do more. I found app which better suit my needs.

The app used to work smoothly, but recently, it has become quite laggy and unresponsive at times. One of the major issues I've encountered is with data synchronization. It's frustrating to see my data not synching properly across devices. This inconsistency makes it difficult to keep track of my finances accurately. I really hope the Monefy team addresses this issues soon.",

I understand you don't show ads and sell the data so subscription is necessary here. However, the price is on higher end. For 1500 we can get Amazon prime membership, so Rs 800 yearly payment seems too high. Just a friendly feedback, again app is great and subscription model is fully justified but not the price.",

And atm withdrawals are considered as cash inflow even though I'm only withdrawing what is already part of salary. Again editable but small hassle.",

Because I usually track my budget at the ends of the day and it hurts my eyes to look at a bright white app. If this app gets a dark mode I'd give it a whole hearted 5 stars Update: can we get a yearly budget feature as well? Let's say I would like to set a gift budget, obviously I wouldn't buy gifts every month.. so can this be done?",

I love the ui design too, it makes it feel fun, like you're playing a game. However, it may not be for everyone if you don't like data entry. I find it fun to enter the details for each transaction and match it to my bank, but it could easily become tedious if that's not for you. One feature I'd like is a way to save templates for common, but random transactions that aren't automatic.",

That's the purpose of keeping a record. Example: Lots of expenses can be categorized as Travel...but travel to where? Categorized snacks, but to who? Yourself? Your daughter? I think you got the picture. Adding notes when you're accoutning for new expenses everyday would be a huge help! Thanks for reading! ‚ô°",
